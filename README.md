## Purpose:  

To benchmark multiple sorting algorithms while maintaining clean code with pylint and autopep8. Scored on the ability to pass all of the provided test cases in test_sort.py  
  
only sort.py is my own work, all other files were provided.

## Method: 
- Generate large, unsorted list
- Check if list is sorted
- Run list copies through sorting algorithms
- Output runtimes
- Ensure passing of provided test cases
